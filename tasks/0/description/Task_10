Solved the 'unupdated status bar on focus out' issue

Prior to this code, the status bar information (especially the coordinates) just freezes when the mouse focuses outside of the graphics view, and also when a file is closed.

I have implemented a method to hide the widgets within the status bar when the mouse focuses out,
and show the widgets when the mouse focuses inside one of the graphic views (i.e. one of the open files).

This method will not (should not) come in the way of status bar messages.
The status bar messages will continue to show regardless.

Also, regarding the status bar message timeout:
there were magic numbers of 2000 scattered throughout the qc_applicationwindow.cpp file.
2000 stands for 2000 milliseconds (or just 2 seconds), which is the time for which
the status bar message will be displayed.

I've assigned them a common constant variable at the top of the file.
This would make future edits simpler.
