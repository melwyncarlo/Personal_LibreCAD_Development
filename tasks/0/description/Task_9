Resolved the 'open existing/deleted file' issues

In both stable and development versions,

if you open up an already open (existing) file, it is supposed to show a warning; which it does.

But then it also opens up another copy of the same file.

I've solved that issue. Now, it no longer opens up multiple copies of the same file;
it shows the warning, as usual, and that's it; it safely returns back from the slotFileOpen function.

Also, upon attempting to open a deleted file from the recently open menu, it shows the aborted error message;
but it does not remove the file listing from the recent menu. I've added a bit of code that removes that particular
file name from the recent menu.

There is an add function in the qg_recentfiles.cpp file.
I have included a simple remove function to it.
