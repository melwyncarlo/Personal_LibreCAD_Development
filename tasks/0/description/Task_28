Solved issue #1386 :  Tangent 3 Circles tool fails randomly with parallel lines

It fails because the two parallel lines always registered as intersecting lines. 
The actual problem lies in the RS_Math::linearSolver() function that is 
called by the LC_Quadratic::getIntersection() function.

The tolerance set was too low (TOLERANCE2 = 1.0E-20), and such a tolerance 
(by its definition) is only meant to be used when dealing with 
decimal multiplication. I've set it to the basic TOLERANCE = 1.0E-10.

It seems to be working all fine now.
