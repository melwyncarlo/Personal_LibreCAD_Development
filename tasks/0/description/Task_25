Solved issue #1327 :  Feature Request: Save a single layer as a dxf

Using this tool, you may now save either selected layers or visible layers, 
either as individual drawing files, or combined into a single drawing file. 
The layer names and attributes are saved as well.

To accomplish this task, I have also created the LC_FileDialogService class. 
This class centralizes the file I/O user interface. So, basically, 
this file dialog can be made to serve multiple purposes by tweaking 
the *.cpp file itself, and passing in just one argument: 
the FileDialogMode enumeration. 

This enumeration tells the class functions how to design the file dialog. 
So, for example, a specific dialog title, specific file filters, 
and particularly, in my case, the Checkbox element embedded 
within the file dialog.
