Solved issue #1395 :  spline through points: snap on middle point fails for last one, when more than one middle point is used

The code talks about splines, but bears the equation of a quadratic Bézier curve.
Also, there is an analytic equation (which is generic) to compute the n-th degree Bézier curve,
but the author of the code uses a very different approach (which is not compatible with the
aforementioned analytic equation).
