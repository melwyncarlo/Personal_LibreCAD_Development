Advanced Snap Middle Manual Tool

Solved issue #1421 :  Feature request: add button to snap middle manual

This tool can snap (set) the relative-zero marker in the middle between two points chosen by the user.

The middle point, by default, rests at a poistion 50% relative to the position of the first point chosen, that is, at the center of the imaginary line connecting the two user-defined points.

This percentage, however, can be modified by the user in order to place the marker at a different position along the imaginary line.

In the video, the dotted lines seemed too faint, so I changed them to dots-and-dashes.
