Set relative zero while doing copy/paste, w.r.t issue #1404

In the file rs_actionmodifymove.cpp (which deals with the Cut operation), 
at line numbers 139 and 145, the moveRelativeZero() functions are present. 
However, they were not present in the Copy and Paste class files; now they are.

As @gerardbm had stated, it assists in copy-pasting at the correct locations.
