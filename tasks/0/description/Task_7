Solved issue #1372 :  Feature request: On-the-fly dimension units

I created the abbreviations by referring to a LibreCAD User Manual (Release 2.2.0):
https://librecad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/appx/measurements.html#systems-of-measurement

I did not implement the micro Î¼ symbol, because no one is going to use it. I used the term, mu, instead.
If the abbreviations need any changes or corrections, do let me know.
