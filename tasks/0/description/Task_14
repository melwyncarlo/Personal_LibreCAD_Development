Removed the 'All files' and 'Any files' options from the 'Import Image' and 'Export PDF' dialogs respectively

In the Import Image and Export PDF dialogs, the 'All files' type amongst other options, makes no sense.

The Export SVG and Export Image dialogs do not have them. 
Then, why do the Import Image and Export PDF dialogs have them?

How would the 'Any files' option benefit the export of a specific type of file (e.g. PDF)?
Wouldn't the import of 'All files' whilst importing specific image file types lead to bugs and/or unpredictable behaviour?
